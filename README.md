# Twitch Unpopular Game Notify

There are unpopular [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/) video game categories that can go for weeks or months without seeing a [live streamer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_streamer). This program sends a notification to your [Amazon Echo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Echo) device when a [streamer](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/s/streamer.htm) begins live streaming your favorite obscure video game.

The intention of this program is to handpick Twitch games that have little to no activity, and to be notified when a streamer begins to live stream that game.

## Requirements

- Cron Job
- A [registered Twitch app](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/authentication#registration)
- Amazon Echo device
- [Notify Me](https://www.thomptronics.com/about/notify-me) Alexa Skill installed on Amazon Echo
